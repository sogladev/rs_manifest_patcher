# Rs Manifest Patcher

A Rust terminal patcher that uses a manifest to manage file updates. It displays a transaction overview, provides detailed progress, and only overwrites files listed in the manifest. It does not remove extra files. Designed for easy extension with minimal dependencies.

Rust-port of [go-manifest-patcher](https://github.com/sogladev/go-manifest-patcher)
